# Metro-Route-Application
A C++ project to develop a metro route application can effectively leverage Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest path between stations. By representing the metro network as a graph, with stations as nodes and tracks as edges, the algorithm efficiently calculates the optimal route.
